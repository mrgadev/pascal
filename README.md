## Pascal

Assalaamu'alaikum, in this repository there are some applications built using Pascal. The menu is made using REPEAT UNTIL iteration. 
<ul>
  <li>Kalkulator BMI: A simple BMI calculator.</li>
  <li>Aritmatika: A simple multiplication table generator.</li>
</ul>

## How to Use

1. You need a Pascal compiler, we recommend using Free Pascal, which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.freepascal.org/download.html">here</a>.
2. Now open terminal, and navigate to Pascal source file (using <code>cd</code> ), which you have downloaded from this repository.
3. Type <code>fpc file_name.pas</code> and hit enter. <code>fpc</code> command are used for compile the source file to produce executable file.
4. Last, type <code>./file_name.pas</code> and hit enter. <code>./</code> command are used for run executable file.

Hope you like it :D
